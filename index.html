            <p>To play, click the audio icon to listen to a tune. Then, make a guess of what you thought each of the
                notes
                were and press enter. Yellow notes are in the tune but in the wrong spot, green notes are in the correct
                spot, and gray notes are not in the tune at all.</p>
